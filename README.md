# Enigneer take home project 

### The Project
Complete an in progress Dashboard that gives a user insights into their accounts receivable.  You will be updating the dashboard to get "live" data from an API service as well as adding a new graph to show their monthly sales over time.

### Requirements
* Create a simple API service using your favorite language, that will return the data needed for the dashboard components.  The data for each component can be found in the following files:
  * [Blogs](./src/app/dashboard/dashboard-components/blog-cards/blog-cards-data.ts)
  * [Feeds](./src/app/dashboard/dashboard-components/feeds/feeds-data.ts)
  * [Monthly Sales](./src/app/dashboard/dashboard-components/monthly-sales/monthly-sales-data.ts)
  * [Top Cards](./src/app/dashboard/dashboard-components/top-cards/top-cards-data.ts)
  * [Top Customers](./src/app/dashboard/dashboard-components/top-customers/top-customers-data.ts)
* Update the angular application to use the api service to get the data needed for the dashboard.  
* Create a new component using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to visualize the users Monthly Sales in a clear and intuitive manner. [A shell component has been started for you.](./src/app/dashboard/dashboard-components/monthly-sales)

### Technical Requirements
* The API service can be written in the language of your choice, but you must include instructions on how to run it and how to interact with it
* Be sure to consider edge cases and error handling
* You will need to have Node.js and npm installed to build the angular application
  * [Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* Have fun and be creative!
